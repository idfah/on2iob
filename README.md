# Quick script to convert Ontonotes 5.x XML files into IOB format for Named Entity Recognition (NER)

---

This is a work in progress.  I wouldn't recommend using it for now because it's a messy and doesn't follow use standard train/dev/test splitting found in most literature on this subject.

Type the following for all command-line options:
```
./on2iob.py --help
```

I think it should be pretty self-explanatory from there.
